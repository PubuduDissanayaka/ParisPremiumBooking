# Paris Premium Booking

This repository contains a simple PHP-based booking form with a JavaScript-powered pricing table. You can open `index.html` in a web browser to test it locally.

To send emails from the form you need a PHP-enabled server. The `sendmail.php` script expects standard POST fields and displays a simple success/failure message.
